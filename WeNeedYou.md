# What You Could Do #

  * Contribute an extension by adding a special mechanism for which you are an expert to AORSL (e.g., various kinds of planning and learning, etc.)
  * Implement an AOR simulator (or simulation management system) in another language of your choice (such as C++ or C#)
  * Connect our simulation management system AOR-JavaSim to external tools such as tools for charting, reporting or statistical/mathematical analysis
  * Connect our simulator to a game engine or to a virtual reality environment
