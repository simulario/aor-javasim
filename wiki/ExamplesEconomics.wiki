== The MIT Beer Game: Supply Chain Dynamics ==

This model describes the classical [http://web.mit.edu/jsterman/www/SDG/beergame.html  MIT Beer Game]. It is a management simulation with a beer supply chain consisting of four nodes: the Retailer, the Wholesaler, the Distributor and the Factory. Every intermediate node has one upstream node to order and receive beer from and one downstream node to receive orders from and to delivery beer to. An order takes 7 days and a delivery takes 14 days. At the end of a week every node decides how much beer to order and calculates its costs for current stock and outstanding orders.
