== Boids Following ==

This example implements the [http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/ flocking behavior] of a swarm by combining the three behaviors of:

    * Separation: avoid collisions with other flockmates
    * Alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
    * Cohesion: steer to move towards the average position of local flockmates

== Bugs in Grid Space ==

This is a kind of "Stupid Model", as described in [http://www.humboldt.edu/~ecomodel/documents/ABMPlatformReview.pdf Railsback, Lytinen and Jackson; 2006]. The model involves bugs that move around randomly in a grid space, feeding, growing and reproducing.
