== Bugs Growing in Grid Space ==

Extend the the AORS example BugsGrowingInGridSpace  towards the full "Stupid Model" described in [http://hydrogen.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/moodle/file.php/38/Review-Agent-based-Simulation-Platforms-Railsback.pdf Railsback, Lytinen and Jackson; 2008]. The model involves Bugs that move around randomly in a grid space. They feed, grow and reproduce. 
Food is represented as a grid cell property. When a bug arrives on a new cell, it eats the available food. The Bugs also employ a reproductive and cannibalistic behavior, implemented in the following way:

1) When two male (or female) bugs meet in one cell the older bug eats the youngest one.

2) When a bug pair (male and female) meets eachother in one cell they reproduce if both of them are older than the maturity level (= 20 Days), otherwise the older bug eats the youngest one. The pregnant female bug will give birth to a new bug after some time interval: the pregnancy interval (= 3 Days).
