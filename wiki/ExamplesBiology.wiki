== Boids Following ==

This example implements the [http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/ flocking behavior] of a swarm by combining the three behaviors of:

    * Separation: avoid collisions with other flockmates
    * Alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
    * Cohesion: steer to move towards the average position of local flockmates

== Bugs in Grid Space ==

This is a kind of "Stupid Model", as described in [http://hydrogen.informatik.tu-cottbus.de/moodle/file.php/38/Review-Agent-based-Simulation-Platforms-Railsback.pdf Railsback, Lytinen and Jackson; 2008]. The model involves Bugs that move around randomly in a grid space. They feed and grow. The Bugs also employ a reproductive and cannibalistic behavior, implemented in the following way:

   * When two male (or female) bugs meet in one cell the older bug eats the youngest one.

   * When a bug pair (male and female) meet each other in one cell they reproduce if both of them are older than the maturity level (= 20 Days), otherwise the older bug eats the youngest one. The pregnant female bug will give birth to a new bug after some time interval: the pregnancy interval (= 3 Days).
