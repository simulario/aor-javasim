This model has been created on 20090821 by Gerd Wagner. It is based on the paper "[http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc08papers/005.pdf Beyond the Chinese Room: The blind jumper] - Self-organised semantics and pragmatics on the computer"] by Peter Fleissner and Gregor Fleissner (published in W. Hofkirchner (Ed.), Information und Selbstorganisation - Ann√§herungen an eine vereinheitlichte Theorie der Information, Innsbruck Wien: StudienVerlag, pp. 325-340, 1998.). See also the <h:a href="http://igw.tuwien.ac.at/peterf/springer/default.htm">original implementation</h:a> by the authors.

In this model, there are two agents and one object, the barrier. One agent (the "jumper")  is not able to see the width of the barrier over which it has to jump, whereas the other one (the "speaker") can see how wide the barrier is and tries to communicate this to the jumper. However, both agents first have to learn using symbols for communicating the width of the barrier. Both agents can perceive the success or failure of a jump (a jump fails if it is too short or too long), and then update their symbol interpretation function accordingly.
