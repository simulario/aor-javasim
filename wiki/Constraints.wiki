#summary This page lists the constraints that a simulation scenario has to satisfy.

= AORSL Constraints =

The following constraints may or may not already be implemented in the AORSL XML schema. There are also some constraints that may overlap like an unique constraint and a key constraint. 

|| *Element* || *Constraint* || *Name of Constraint* when implemented ||
|| `SimulationParameters` || Name must refer to an existing `SimulationParameterDeclaration` (key/keyref) ||


`SimulationParameterDeclaration`
------------------------------
They must be unqiue. GlobalVariables might be also considered.
	-> key (because later they must refered from the scenarios simulationParameter)

It must be prohibited, that a parameter can have a name of a default parameter.
	-> type






GlobalVariables | StatisticVariables
------------------------------------
They must be unqiue. SimulationParameters might be also considered.
	-> unique

StatisticVariables
------------------
Their sourceObjectType and -Property must be references to exisiting ObjectTypes and their properties.
	-> keyref for the 1st part
	-> assertion for the 2nd part

GlobalVariables
---------------
If refDataType is used, it must refer to an exisiting EntityType.
	-> keyref

It must be ensured that refDataType and dataType are not used at the same time.
	-> assertion






DataTypes
---------
-> see EntityTypes

EntityType
----------
An EntityTypes name must be unique.
	-> unique constraint

An EntityTypes superType attribute must refer to another EntityType. Furthermore it must refer to another EntityType of the same type.
	-> key/keyref

EntityType/InitialAttributeValue
--------------------------------
It must refer to an default attribute or - if existiting - to an attribute of the superType.
	-> assertion (at least for the reference to default attributes)
	-> maybe an key/keyref for the reference to a superType's attribute possible

EntityType/Attribute | EntityType/ReferenceProperty | EntityType/SelfBeliefProperties | BeliefEntityType/BeliefProperties
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The properties names must ne unique within an entity.
	-> unique constraint

Can it override an already defined property of its supertype. If not it must be prohibited.
	-> maybe unique constraint
	-> otherwise assertion

EntityType/ReferencProperty | BeliefEntity/BeliefReferenProperty
----------------------------------------------------------------
It must refer to an existing EntityType (or in case of a BeliefEntityType to an exisiting BeliefEntityType).
	-> key/keyref

EntityTypes/BeliefEntityTypes | EntityTypes/Events
--------------------------------------------------
Like the "top-level" EntityTypes their names must be also unique but just within the range of their parent.
	-> unique

EntityTypes/Rules
-----------------
Their names must be unique within the range of their parent.
	-> unqiue






Function | SubjectiveFunction | GlobalFunction
----------------------------------------------
Its resultType must be wether a datatype or a reference to an existing EntityType, ComplexDataType or Collection.
	-> assertion
	-> or if devided into to two kinds of resultType (resultDatatype and resultObjecttype) an key/keyref might be possible for the object part. an assertion would be useful to ensure that not both resultTypes are used at the same time.

Function/Parameter | SubjectiveFunction/Parameter
-------------------------------------------------
It must refer to an existing EntityType, ComplexDataType or Collection. Or its type must be a datatype.
	-> assertion
	-> if devided into to kinds of parameter (datatypeParameter and objectParameter) an key/keyref might be possible for the object part

Their names must be unique within the functions range.
	-> unique







SpaceModel
----------
the GridCellProperties must be keys. It may be also required that they are distinvt to the default spacemodel parameters
	-> key
	-> assertion for the 2nd part

Collections
-----------
-> see Objects





EnvironmentRules/WHEN
---------------------
The type attributes must refer to an existiting message/physicalObject/event-Type.
	-> key/keyref
	-> assertion for built-in types (alternativly another parameter for those)


The variables must be unique within the rules range and they must be different to global variables.
	-> unqiue (see also global variables)


EnvironmentRules/FOR
--------------------
The type attributes must refer to an existing objectType.
	-> key/keyref
	-> asserting for built-in types (alternativly another parameter for those)

The variables must be unique within the rules range and they must be different to global variables.
	-> unqiue (see also global variables)


EnvironmentRules/UPDATE-ENV/Update|IncrementGlobalVaribale
----------------------------------------------------------
Thy must refer to an existing global variable.
	-> key/keyref


EnvironmentRules/UPDATE-ENV/UpdateObject
----------------------------------------
The variables type and the called slots must refer to an existing type/property.
	-> assertion
	-> assertion (also for ids when expression language is used)

The variables name must be unique within the rules but just the components part.
	-> unique (for component level)
	-> assertion (for rule level)


EnvironmentRules/UPDATE-ENV/UpdateGridCell
------------------------------------------
A Slot must refere to an existing property.
	-> key/keyref


The variables name must be unique within the rules but just the components part.
	-> unique (for component level)
	-> assertion (for rule level)


EnvironmentRules/UPDATE-ENV/UpdateObjects
-----------------------------------------
The objectType must refer to an exisiting type.
	-> key/keyref
	-> assertion for built-in (or extra attribute)

The slot must refer th a types property.
	-> assertion

The variables name must be unique within the rules but just the components part.
	-> unique (for component level)
	-> assertion (for rule level)


EnvironmentRules/UPDATE-ENV/AddObjectToCollection|RemoveObjectFromCollection
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
The collectionName must refer to an exisiting collection.
	-> key/keyref

The variables name must be unique within the rules but just the components part.
	-> unique (for component level)
	-> assertion (for rule level)



EnvironmentRules/UPDATE-ENV/Increment|Decrement
-----------------------------------------------
To what do they refer?
Why value restricted to long and not tu "numeric"?

The property must refer to an exitising one.
	-> key/keyref


EnvironmentRules/UPDATE-ENV/UpdateStatisticsVariable
----------------------------------------------------
The variable must refer to an exitising one.
	-> key/keyref
