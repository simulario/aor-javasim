= Examples of Simulation Scenarios =

A _*simulation scenario*_ is an XML file that you can 
  * _*view*_ in your Web browser (if it supports XSLT);
  * download (by right-clicking the link and choosing "save link as") and then
    * _*inspect*_ with the help of an XML editor (e.g. [http://www.oxygenxml.com/ OxygenXML] or the open source [http://sourceforge.net/projects/xml-copy-editor/ XML Copy] editor);
    * _*run*_ on your computer (as a Java program) with AOR-!JavaSim;
    * _*run*_ in your Web browser (as a JavaScript program) by submitting it to our simulation server (forthcoming)

AOR simulation models and simulation scenarios are expressed in a high-level declarative language (AORSL). This makes them more readable, more accessible and more maintainable compared to other simulation frameworks (such as Netlogo and !RePast). Consequently, the AOR simulation model library  is a valuable resource for those who want to study, or do research in, simulation.
