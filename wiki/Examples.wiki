This example has been created on 20090331 by Oana Nicolae and Gerd Wagner. It is based on the paper [http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc08papers/005.pdf Introduction to Simulation] by R.G. Ingalls (published in Proceedings of the 2008 Winter Simulation Conference). 

As a car enters from the street, the driver, who we will call Fred, decides whether or not to get in line. If Fred decides to leave the restaurant, he leaves as a dissatisfied customer. If Fred decides to get in line, then he waits until the menu board is available. At that time, Fred gives the order to the order taker. After the order is taken, then two things occur simultaneously:
  # Fred moves forward if there is room, otherwise he has to wait at the menu board until there is room to move forward.
  # The order is sent electronically back to the kitchen where it is prepared as soon as the cook is available.
  # As soon as Fred reaches the pickup window, then he pays and picks up his food, if it is ready. If the food is not ready, then Fred has to wait until his order is prepared.
