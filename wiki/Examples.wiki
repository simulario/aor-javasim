= Examples of Simulation Scenarios =

A _*simulation scenario*_ is an XML file that you can 
  * _*view*_ in your Web browser (if it supports XSLT);
  * download (by right-clicking the link and choosing "save link as") and then
    * _*inspect*_ with the help of an XML editor (e.g. [http://sourceforge.net/projects/xml-copy-editor/ XML Copy]);
    * _*run*_ on your computer as a Java program with AOR-!JavaSim;
    * _*run*_ in your Web browser by submitting it to the Simulario server (forthcoming)

AOR simulation models and simulation scenarios are expressed in a high-level declarative language (AORSL). This makes them more readable and more accessible compared to other simulation frameworks (such as Netlogo and !RePast). Consequently, the AOR simulation model library  is a valuable resource for those who want to study or do research in simulation. We plan to continuously extend it.
