#summary A summary of new features planned for future versions of AOR-JavaSim

= New Features in 0.8 =


  * Introduce a special empty subelement `ON-EACH-SIMULATION-STEP` of !EnvironmentRule, as an alternative to `WHEN`,  for rules that are executed at each step
  * The !SimulationScenario/@version attribute will be mandatory and fixed to the schema version
  * Suppport FOR loops over supertypes through code generation (e.g. if Animal is the supertype of Predator and Prey, a FOR loop over Animal will create two loops: one over Predator  and another one over Prey)
  * Support continuous property value changes by introducing a new Property subelement (!ContinousChangeExpr) such that the value of such a property is re-computed at each simulation step according to this expression

= New Features Planned for the Future =

== AORSL Schema Features ==

  * It should be possible to select among a set of supported schemas
  * Provide a shrinked schema ("ERSL") for basic discrete event simulation without agents ("ER Simulation")
  * Provide an extended "AORSLX" schema in addition to the standard AORSL schema. This extended schema will, for instance, include certain predefined agent types such as `TrustfulAndSincereAgent`
  * Integrate the expression language AORSEL with the extended schema

== Other Features ==

  * Support the transportation of physical objects by physical agents by introducing the following:
    * a built-in action event type `LoadTransportObject` with a reference property `transportObject`
    * a built-in action event type `UnloadTransportObject` with a reference property `transportObject`
    * a new list-valued built-in attribute `transportObjects` such that these objects are moved along with the agent (possibly by injecting code for moving them into the setX/setY methods of the physical agent object)
