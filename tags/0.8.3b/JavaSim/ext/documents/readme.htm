        <h1>Directions for installing AOR-JavaSim</h1>
        <h2>The Java Simulation Management System for Agent-Object-Relationship (AOR) Simulation</h2>
        <div>
<p>Requires the installation of a Java 6 Development Kit from the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp">Java SE download site</a> (choose, e.g., <strong>JDK 6 Update 14</strong> or later).</p>
<ol>
<li>Extract the ZIP file (with the option "use path names") to a folder of your choice (for instance to <kbd>D:\</kbd>).</li>
<li>Some of the application modules (e.g. visualization) are OS dependent, therefore you may need to download additional files for such modules. By default,
the distribution comes prepared for Windows 32bits version. If you are using another OS, please download the jar module file
for the OS where you need to run the AOR-JavaSim, and copy it to the <code>modules</code> directory located on AOR-JavaSim
application main folder. You may have multiple versions of the same module in that directory, the application will load
only the appropriate version for you, based on the current running OS on your PC.</li>
<li>Start the program <kbd>AOR-Simulator.exe</kbd></li>
<li>You can use a simple text editor for writing AOR simulation scenarios. But using an XML editor has several advantages: 1) you get <em>syntax guidance</em> by syntax highlighting and by auto-completion, 2) you can immediately check your file for syntactic correctness by using the validation function.</li>
<li>A good open source XML editor is the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/xml-copy-editor/">XML Copy Editor</a>. Under Tools/Options you have to uncheck the "Save UTF-8 Byte Order Mark" (this option is on the right bottom part).</li>
<li>Then you can choose this editor as your external editor under View/Preferences in AOR-JavaSim.</li>
</ol>		

<p>After starting the simulator you can open a sample scenario file by going to the <kbd>projects</kbd> directory, choosing one of the area subfolders (e.g. "Biology") and then one of the examples (e.g. "BugsInGridSpace"). Then, go to the <strong>Build</strong> drop down menu and click <strong>Build all</strong> (alternatively, press Ctrl-B). If there are no error messages, you can then run the sample scenario by clicking the <strong>Run</strong> button (or pressing Ctrl-R), going either to the Visualization tab or to the Statistics tab for observing the simulation run.</p>
