	<title>Introduction</title>
	<para>So far agent-based modeling (ABM) is a powerful simulation modeling technique that has been
		extensively developed and well used in a lot of areas, because it can provide many effective
		methods to facilitate the research into the complex problems of different scientific fields.
		In ABM, a system is modeled as a collection of independent acting units called agents. Each
		agent is able to perceive things and make decisions based on a set of rules. The model which
		will be described in this paper used ABM to explore the fields of economics. It focuses on
		an economy to analyse how the effects of different spatial distributions of economic policy
		measures depend on spatial frictions in the labor market expressed as commuting costs of
		workers who are employed outside their home-region. The purpose of this paper is to remodel
		it as a multi-agent based simulation using the Agent-Object-Relationship (AOR) simulation
		technology that was developed by Prof. Dr. Gerd Wagner and other team members at the
		Brandenburg University of Technology.</para>
	<para>This thesis is organized as follows. Chapter 2 gives a general overview of the economic
		model. Chapter 3 offers a detailed analysis of the model. Chapter 4 presents the AOR
		simulation and the reconstructed model. Chapter 5 provides some simulation results, and
		Chapter 6 concludes.</para>
