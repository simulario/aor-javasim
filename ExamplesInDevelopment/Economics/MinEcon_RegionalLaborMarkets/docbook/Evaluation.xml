	<title>Evaluation</title>
	<para>This chapter firstly gives an evaluation about the effect of the model reconstruction. After
		that, the advantages and disadvantages of the AOR simulation technology, which is used to
		reconstruct the original model, will be discussed.</para>
	<para>From chapter 6 the comparison between the results of the original model and those of the
		reconstructed model indicates that the reconstructed results basically agree with the
		original ones except the simulation results of the output of producers with low commuting
		costs in the low-high scenario. The reason of this difference has been analysed and
		illustrated in detail in chapter 6. It is shown that the output results of producers in the
		original model are unconvincing and there is evidence that the reconstructed results are
		more persuasive and accord with reality. Moreover, the curve shapes of some simulation
		results between the two models differ only in small details, but in fact the little
		differences do not affect the accuracy of the reconstructed results. There are several
		reasons which could lead to these differences. First, in the original model the initial
		values of properties of agents are not clearly provided. Fortunately, most of them can be
		derived by the curves of simulation results from the original model, but the others, which
		might be away from the original initial values, come from the empirical assumptions that may
		affect the curve trends of the simulation results. Second, several rules and functions in
		the original model are only simply touched upon without any detailed description. For
		example, the estimated demand distribution, which is used to calculate the optimal stock
		level, is not clearly spelled out. So instead a uniform distribution is used in the
		reconstructed model. Because the optimal stock level determines the output of producers, its
		change can not only influence the results of the output of producers, but other relevant
		simulation results as well. Therefore, the difference is strongly associated with the
		imperfection of the original model.</para>
	<para>Totally speaking, compared with the original results, it shows that the reconstructed
		model is effective and reliable. In other words, the reconstruction of the original model
		with the help of the AOR simulation technology is successful. In the process of the model
		reconstruction, there are some advantages, which can improve efficiency of reconstruction.
		First, Using the AOR simulation the original model is reconstructed in a high-level
		declarative language called AORSL with an XML-based syntax. This language is very easy to
		write and read. Second, AORSL has the well defined structure, so the simulation scenarios
		can be easily created. Third, the language can be validated directly in the process of
		programming. Fourth, in the running of the simulation, an XML based simulation log can be
		created. It helps to check the source of errors.</para>
	<para>However, during the reconstruction of the original model one weakness of the AORSL was found.
		In the ReactionRule or EnvironmentRule, IF-THEN-ELSE can be used to perform some actions
		based on a boolean condition. Specifically, if the condition is true, the THEN instruction
		is taken, if not, the ELSE instruction is taken. The ELSE instruction is optional. But in
		the original model, there are some rules, which can have different results based on several
		different conditions. In such circumstances, by using IF-THEN-ELSE, it is impossible to
		combine several conditions. This leads to a lot of repeated work and code
		redundancies.</para>
