# Examples of Biology Simulation Models #

## Boids Following ##

This example implements the [flocking behavior](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/boids/) of a swarm by combining the three behaviors of:

  * Separation: avoid collisions with other flockmates
  * Alignment: steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
  * Cohesion: steer to move towards the average position of local flockmates

## Bugs in Grid Space ##

This is a kind of "Stupid Model", as described in [Railsback, Lytinen and Jackson; 2006](http://www.humboldt.edu/~ecomodel/documents/ABMPlatformReview.pdf). The model involves bugs that move around randomly in a grid space, feeding, growing and reproducing.
