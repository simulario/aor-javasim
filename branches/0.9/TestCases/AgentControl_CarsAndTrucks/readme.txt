To run this example the trunk-version of the simulator is requried.

Ensure, that the newest codegeneration is used:

Open the "properties.xml" file and set the value for the entry

   "CodeGen.XSLT.file.path" to the directory of the new code generation

and

   "codeGen.XSLT.file.name" to "aorsml2programmingLanguage.xsl".

After building the simulation the images have to be copied manually to the directory once*:

%imulationdir%/src/interaction/agentControl

* This step has to be repeated if the simulation directory changes.

Enjoy the simulation.
