The student also has to take care of her every day life. She needs to find the right balance between studying, relaxing and enjoying a social life. Some students may have to secure sufficient income for their living expenses, if their parents do not support them and they neither get a fellowship. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>Modeling students, and other persons such as professors, may be based on a general personality model.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>There are two possible time models for this game:</span></p><ol class="c2" start="1"><li class="c4 c1"><span>In &quot;user time&quot; a semester week is defined by a set of study activities (attending a lecture, submitting an assignment, taking an exam, etc.) with a timeout clock (say, 30 min) for finishing the week. The game can be interrupted any time such that it&#39;s state will be saved and restored when the player connects again.</span></li><li class="c4 c1"><span>In &quot;calendar time&quot; an in-game semester lasts for 14 real days, such that each day allows one session with a timeout clock (say, 30 min) corresponding to an in-game week, which is lost when the player doesn&#39;t connect on that day.</span></li></ol><p class="c1"><span>For each semester week the player checks the study schedule and decides what to do.</span></p><h3 class="c1"><span>Agent Types</span></h3><p class="c1"><span>Student, Professor,</span></p><h3 class="c1"><span>Object Types</span></h3><p class="c1"><span>StudyProgram, Module, Course, CourseParticipation, Lecture, Assignment, AssignmentSolution,</span></p><h3 class="c1"><span>Event Types</span></h3><ol class="c2" start="1"><li class="c4 c1"><span class="c6">Time events</span><span>: StartOfSemester, EndOfSemester, StartOfSemesterWeek, EndOfSemesterWeek,</span></li><li class="c1 c4"><span class="c6">Action events</span><span>: EnrollForStudyProgram, EnrollForCourse, AttendLecture, SubmitAssignment, TakeExam, MeetFellowStudentsAtCafeteria, GoToParty, HaveLunch, TakeSomeSleep,</span></li><li class="c4 c1"><span class="c6">Perception events</span><span>:</span></li><li class="c4 c1"><span class="c6">Exogenous events</span><span>: Party, &nbsp;</span></li></ol><p class="c1 c5"><span></span></p></body></html>
