				This schema defines an XML based expression language. The
				language supports arithmetic and logical expressions as well as
				basic lexical operations. It is split into the sub schemas
				"Terms and Datatypes", "Boolean Operations", "Numeric
				Operations" and "String Operations". ALLEX is as extensible
				language designed. So it provides various type definitions that
				allow to extend this language easily.
