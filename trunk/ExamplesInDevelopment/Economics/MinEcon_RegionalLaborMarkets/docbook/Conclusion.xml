	<title>Conclusion</title>
	<para>In this paper an agent-based spatial macroeconomic model is chosen for reconstruction. There
		are two special results of this thesis: First, although the original model is very complex
		and contains too many varibales and parameters, it can be reconstructed very well with the
		help of the AOR simulation technology. Second, and most important, AOR simulation is a
		powerful approach regarding the study and the development of multi-agent models. In fact,
		this approach has many advantages. It uses a well defined metamodel and simulation language
		AORSL that can be executed directly with special simulation software AOR-JavaSim. This
		language is based on XML, so it is very easy to write and read.</para>
