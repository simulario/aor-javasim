<section>
<h1>Event Types</h1>
<p>Certain events are shown as alerts to the player (they indicate a missing player action).</p>
<ul>
 <li><b>WakeUp</b>: An event of this type occurs whenever the player logs in on a new calendar day or after aging her animal. 
 It leads to setting the clock at 8:00.</li>
 <li><b>MakeDroppings</b>: This event occurs randomly with a mean of 3 times a day (or in some way species-specific).</li>
 <li><b>LossOfEnergy</b>: occurs after some time 
  <ul><li>if the animal is not fed, </li>
  <li>during a race or training (physical effort) </li>
  <li>if the animal is neglected</li>
  <li>when the animal has certain health problems </li>
  </ul></li>
 <li><b>GainOfEnergy</b> occurs when the horse is relaxing, or feeding, or when it is receiving attention and care. </li>
 <li><b>GetInfection</b> and <b>GetInjured</b>: During a race or training a GetInjured event may occur. Pets can also get an infection randomly (but very seldom). Both events create a health problem that requires a special treatment.</li>
 </ul>
</section>
  
<section>
 <h1>Simulation Time Progression</h1>
 <p>Simulation time is decoupled from "aging time", which is player/animal-specific and is advanced according to a combination 
 of player actions and calendar time. For instance, while during 3 consecutive calendar days the simulation time for 
 player A may advance by 3 days (since she logs in on each of these 3 days), it may advance by 1 day only for player B 
 (if he logs in only once during these 3 days).</p>
 
  <section>
  <h1>Simulation Time Progression by Player Actions</h1>
  <p>With each calendar day on which the player logs in, the animal ages by one day. In the sessions within a calendar day, 
  there is a 15 minutes time advancement for each player action.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
  <h1>Simulation Time Progression by Calendar Time</h1>
  <p>After some number of calendar days without any  login (say, after 3 calendar days), simulation time is advanced by 1 day</p>

<h1>Appendix: Nutrition Model</h1>

<section>
<h1><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)">Protein</a></h1>
<p>Proteins contain 16.8 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilo-" >kilo</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule">joules</a> 
(4 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calories">Calories</a>) per gram as opposed to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lipid">lipids</a> 
which contain 37.8 kilojoules (9 Calories). Note that 1 Calorie = 1 kilocalorie = 4.184 kilojoules.</p>
<p>How much protein needed in a person's daily diet is determined in large part by overall energy intake, as well as by the body's need for nitrogen and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_amino_acid" title="Essential amino acid">essential amino acids</a>. Physical activity and exertion as well as enhanced muscular mass increase the need for protein. Requirements are also greater during childhood for growth and development, during pregnancy or when breast-feeding in order to nourish a baby, or when the body needs to recover from malnutrition or trauma or after an operation It was suggested that protein intake amount should be measured by using three parameters (which should be viewed together): absolute intake (g/d), intake per body weight (g/body kg/d) and intake as energy percent.<sup class="reference" style="font-style:normal"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_(nutrient)#cite_note-IJSNEM-4">[5]</a></sup></p>
<p>If enough energy is not taken in through diet, as in the process of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starvation" title="Starvation">starvation</a>, the body will use protein from the muscle mass to meet its energy needs, leading to muscle wasting over time. If the individual does not consume adequate protein in nutrition, then muscle will also waste as more vital cellular processes (e.g. respiration enzymes, blood cells) recycle muscle protein for their own requirements.</p>

<h1><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate">Carbohydrates</a></h1>
<p>Monosaccharides are the major source of fuel for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metabolism">metabolism</a>, 
being used both as an energy source (glucose being the most important in nature) and in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biosynthesis">biosynthesis</a>. When monosaccharides are not immediately needed by many cells 
they are often converted to more space efficient forms, often <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polysaccharide">polysaccharides</a>. 
In many animals, including humans, this storage form is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycogen">glycogen</a>, especially in liver and muscle cells. 
In plants, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch">starch</a> is used for the same purpose.</p>
<p>Foods high in carbohydrates include <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bread">breads</a>,

and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cereal">cereals</a>. Most such foods are high in 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starch">starch</a>. Carbohydrates are the most common source of energy in living organisms. 
Proteins and fat are necessary building components for body <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_tissue">tissue</a>
and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_(biology)">cells</a>, and are also a source of energy for most organisms.</p>

<p>Carbohydrates are not <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_nutrient" title="Essential nutrient">essential nutrients</a> in humans: the body can obtain all its energy from protein and fats<sup class="reference" style="font-style:normal"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate#cite_note-9">[10]</a></sup><sup class="reference" style="font-style:normal"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbohydrate#cite_note-10">[11]</a></sup>. The brain and neurons generally cannot burn fat for energy, but can use glucose or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketone_bodies" title="Ketone bodies">ketones</a>; the body can also synthesize some glucose from a few of the amino acids in protein and also from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycerol" title="Glycerol">glycerol</a> backbone in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride" title="Triglyceride">triglycerides</a>. Carbohydrate contains 15.8 <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilo-" title="Kilo-">kilo</a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joule" title="Joule">joules</a> (3.75 <a class="mw-redirect" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kilocalorie" title="Kilocalorie">kilocalories</a>)<sup class="Template-Fact">[<i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed">citation needed</a></i>]</sup>and proteins 16.8 kilojoules (4 kilocalories) per <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gram" title="Gram">gram</a>, while fats contain 37.8 kilojoules (9 kilocalories) per gram. In the case of protein, this is somewhat misleading as only some amino acids are usable for fuel. Likewise, in humans, only some carbohydrates are usable for fuel, as in many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monosaccharide" title="Monosaccharide">monosaccharides</a> and some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disaccharide" title="Disaccharide">disaccharides</a>. Other carbohydrate types can be used, but only with the assistance of gut bacteria.<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruminant" title="Ruminant">Ruminants</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Termite" title="Termite">termites</a> can even process <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellulose" title="Cellulose">cellulose</a>, which is indigestible to humans.</p>
<p>Based on the effects on risk of heart disease and obesity, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_and_Agriculture_Organization" title="Food and Agriculture Organization">Food and Agriculture Organization</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Health_Organization" title="World Health Organization">World Health Organization</a> jointly recommend that national dietary guidelines set a goal of 55–75% of total energy from carbohydrates, but only 10% directly from sugars (their term for simple carbohydrates).</p>
